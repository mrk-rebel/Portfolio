## Hi there!

I'm Melissa, a data scientist enthusiastic about analysis and visual storytelling. <br/>I studied Physics at the University of Sao Paulo, earned a Bachelor of Arts in Cinema and Media Studies from the University of Southern California, and have recently earned a Master's degree in Applied Data Science from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

### Check out my recent projects:


## <a href="https://github.com/mrk-rebel/capstone" rel="The Look of Hate on Reddit">![gh](gh64.png)</a> The Look of Hate on Reddit

> Investigation of hateful/toxic language on Reddit with an emphasis on gender culminating in a visual essay.<br/>
My contribution included the conceptualization of the project, its definition--alongside another contributor--and then setting up the scope of the data to be acquired, scraping it, cleaning it, and processing it. I created the visual identity and visualizations for the essay and oversaw all aspects of the team project, including adhering to deadlines, delegating tasks, creating a GitHub repository, managing files, and publishing the article (using Deepnote).

## <a href="https://github.com/mrk-rebel/Milestone-II" rel="Predicting text difficulty with different learning frameworks and feature representations">![gh](gh64.png)</a> Predicting text difficulty with different learning frameworks and feature representations
> This was first the data science project on which I worked with two other collaborators and it was a great way to practice file organization and delegating tasks. We ended up dealing with a collaborator that needed to step back after the first week and return in the last week, so the project became an exercise in absorbing extra workload, redistributing tasks, and re-integrating a collaborator near the deadline.

> I was tasked with comparing two counties for the expansion of a chain restaurant and making a recommendation while presenting the results in the form of an executive summary, a technical report and a recorded presentation. I used demographic data from Gale Business DemographicsNow, census survey, economic data from the Federal Reserve, counties and cities websites, Google maps, and Yelp to understand counties' populations and their consumption habits.

> I was tasked to make a live presentation on the results of my exploring a given data set (Covid-19 data from Korean CDC). I was supposed to present at least one basic and one advanced visualization and to explain my process. My presentation explores the same aspects of data using different visualization methods to explain their benefits and limitations.
